I grew up
Calling home
Violence and drugs
Needles and whores
A grey place
Where dreams
Would hardly grow

Then why,
For fuck's sake,
My eyes prickle
For blinking lights,
Tall trees and fireflies?
Echoing laughter
And Tears and fears
Choking on nostalgia

Shining jewels
In the form of people
Is all I wanna keep
Of what I once
Called home
